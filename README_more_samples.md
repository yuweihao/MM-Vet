**Q**: What is this disease (give short introduction) and how to treat it?

**GT**: It is club root. Affecting most brassica crops (cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower, etc.), club root is a serious plant disease in North American home gardens. It is caused by the soil-borne fungus Plasmodiophora brassicae which infects susceptible plants through root hairs. Diseased roots become swollen, misshapen and deformed (clubbed) often cracking and rotting. As a result, plants have difficulty absorbing water and nutrients properly.<br><br>Plants often grow poorly and wilt during the heat of the day; plants often revive during cool nights. Outer leaves may turn yellow, purple or brown. Club root will reduce yields and can cause total crop failure.<br><br>Fungal spores can be spread by wind, water and garden tools. Disease development can occur over a wide range of conditions, but is favored by excessive moisture, low soil pH and soil temperatures between 64 and 77˚F. Spores can survive in the soil for as many as 10 years.<br><br>Treatment<br>1. Fungicides will NOT treat this soil-dwelling micro-organism.<br>2. Choose resistant cultivars when possible.<br>3. Try to prevent the occurrence of this disease by keeping a clean garden and rotating crops.<br>4. Keep in mind that the disease spores can persist in the soil for up to 20 years. If club root is present you may want to solarize the soil.*<br>5. Control susceptible weeds \u2014 mustard, radish, shepherd\u2019s purse \u2014 that may be infected to reduce potential buildup of the disease.<br>6. Carefully remove infected plants and sterilize garden tools (one part bleach to 4 parts water) after use.<br>7. Raise your soil\u2019s pH to a more alkaline 7.2 by mixing oyster shell or dolomite lime into your garden in the fall. Simple and affordable soil test kits are available to check pH often.

**Q**: The graph and table below give information about water use worldwide and water consumption in two different countries.<br><br>Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.<br><br>You should write at least 150 words.

**GT**: The charts compare the amount of water used for agriculture, industry and homes around the world, and water use in Brazil and the Democratic Republic of Congo.<br><br>It is clear that global water needs rose significantly between 1900 and 2000, and that agriculture accounted for the largest proportion of water used. We can also see that water consumption was considerably higher in Brazil than in the Congo.<br><br>In 1900, around 500km³ of water was used by the agriculture sector worldwide. The figures for industrial and domestic water consumption stood at around one fifth of that amount. By 2000, global water use for agriculture had increased to around 3000km³, industrial water use had risen to just under half that amount, and domestic consumption had reached approximately 500km³.<br><br>In the year 2000, the populations of Brazil and the Congo were 176 million and 5.2 million respectively. Water consumption per person in Brazil, at 359m³, was much higher than that in the Congo, at only 8m³, and this could be explained by the fact that Brazil had 265 times more irrigated land.

**Q**: Chorleywood is a village near London whose population has increased steadily since the middle of the nineteenth century. The map below shows the development of the village.<br><br>Write a report for a university lecturer describing the development of the village. <br><br>You should write at least 150 words.

**GT**: The map shows the growth of a village called Chorleywood between 1868 and 1994.<br><br>It is clear that the village grew as the transport infrastructure was improved. Four periods of development are shown on the map, and each of the populated areas is near to the main roads, the railway or the motorway.<br><br>From 1868 to 1883, Chorleywood covered a small area next to one of the main roads. Chorleywood Park and Golf Course is now located next to this original village area. The village grew along the main road to the south between 1883 and 1922, and in 1909 a railway line was built crossing this area from west to east. Chorleywood station is in this part of the village.<br><br>The expansion of Chorleywood continued to the east and west alongside the railway line until 1970. At that time, a motorway was built to the east of the village, and from 1970 to 1994, further development of the village took place around motorway intersections with the railway and one of the main roads.
