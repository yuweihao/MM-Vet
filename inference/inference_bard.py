Install bardapi by
```bash
pip install bardapi
```

Run this script by
```bash
while true; do python inference_bard.py; sleep 60; done
```
Currently we have to use loop in bash instead of python because the Bard-API seems have a bug.

Remember to change your image folder and meta data path in this script.
